//SOURCE OF DATA

//1- from the program itself: data written derectly in the source of code

//2 - from the UI: data input from the user or data written in DOM (ex to-do app)

//3 - From external sources: data for example web API (recipe objects)

// SIMPLE LIST?? - ARRAY or SET
// KEY VALUES PAIR?? - USE OBJECTS OR MAPS

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------

//ARRAY - 
    // USE WHENEVER YOU NEED AN ORDENERED LIST OF VALUES(MIGHT CONTAIN DUPLICATES)
    // WHEN YOU NEED TO MANIPULATE DATA


//SETS - 
    //USE WHEN YOU NEED TO WORK WITH UNIQUE VALUES
    //USE WHEN HIGHT-PERFORMANCE IS REALLY IMPORTANT
    //USE TO REMOVE DUPLICATES FROM ARRAYS

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

//OBJECTS
    //MORE 'TRADITIONAL' KEY VALUE STORED
    //EASIER TO WRITE AND ACCESS VALUES WITH AN []
    //USE WHEN YOU NEED TO INCLUDE FUNCTIONS(METHODS)
    //USE WHEN YOU ARE WORKING WITH JSON

//MAPS
    //BETTER PERFORMANCE
    //KEYS CAN HAVE ANY DATA TYPE
    //EASY TO ITERATE
    //EASY TO COMPUTE SIZE
    //USE WHEN YOU SIMPLY NEED TO MAP KEY TO VALUES
    //USE WHEN YOU NEED KEYS THAT ARE NOT STRINGS
