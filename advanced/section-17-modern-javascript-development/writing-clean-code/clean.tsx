//READABLE CODE
//write code so that other people can understand it 
//write code so you can understand it in one year
//avoid, too clever and overcomplicated solutions
//use descriptive variables names: what they contain
//use descriptive functions names: what they do



//GENERAL
//use DRY principle ( refactor your code)
//don't pollute global namespace encapsulate instead
//don't use var
//use strong type checks (=== and !==)


//FUNCTIONS
//generally functions should do only one thing
//Don't use more than 3 functions parameters
//use default parameters whenever possible
//Generaly return, same data type as received
//use arrow funtions when they make code more reabadle

//OOP
//use ES6 classes
//Encapsulate data don't motate it from outside class
//implement method chaining
//dont use arrow function as methods(in regular objects)

//AVOID NESTED CODE
//use early return (guard clauses)
//use ternary (conditional) or logical operators instead of if
//use multiple if instead of if/else-if
//avoid for loops use array methods instead
//avoid call-back based asynchronous APIs


//ASYNCHRONOUS CODE
//consume promisses with async/await for best readability
//whenever possible, run promisses in parallel (promisse.all)
