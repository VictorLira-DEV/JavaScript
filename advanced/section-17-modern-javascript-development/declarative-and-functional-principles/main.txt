//IMPERATIVE]

//programmer explains "how to do things"
//we explain in computer every single step it has to follow to achieve a result
//we need to give a step by step recepi of cake

//DECLARATIVE
//programmer tells what to do
//we simply describe the way the computer should  achieve the result
//the HOW (step-by-step result) gets abstract away
//description of a cake

//functional programming
declarative programming paradign
based on the idea of writing software by combinig many  pure functions, avoid side effects and mutating data
side effect: modification (mutation) of any data outside of the function (mutating external variables, logging to 
console, writing to DOM, etc)

//immutabity
state() data is nerver modified! instead, state is copied and copy is mutated and returned
